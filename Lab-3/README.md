Lab 03 – Styling and Layout with CSS and Flexbox
Exercise 1 – Styling a Webpage Using CSS

In Exercise 1, we enhanced an existing HTML webpage by adding custom CSS styling. We created and linked an external stylesheet to define color schemes, text formatting, and layout structure. This exercise emphasized how CSS properties such as color, font, and margin contribute to a webpage’s overall presentation and readability. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with separating content from design and maintaining clean, modular code.

Exercise 2 – Flexbox

In Exercise 2, we explored the Flexbox layout model to build responsive and adaptable page structures. We experimented with key Flexbox properties such as flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, and flex-wrap to control spacing, alignment, and flow within a container. By adjusting these attributes, we learned how Flexbox simplifies responsive design and creates layouts that adjust naturally to different screen sizes.

Exercise 3 – Navigation Bar

In Exercise 3, we applied our CSS and Flexbox knowledge to design a fully functional navigation bar. The navbar included hover effects, background color changes, and dropdown functionality to organize links efficiently. This exercise combined structure and interactivity, reinforcing concepts of layout hierarchy and user experience design while practicing real-world web interface techniques.
