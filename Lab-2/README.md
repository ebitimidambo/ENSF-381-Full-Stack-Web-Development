ENSF 381 – HTML Labs

This repository contains lab exercises completed as part of the ENSF 381 Full-Stack Web Development course at the University of Calgary.
Each exercise focuses on building a foundation in web development using core front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Exercise 1 – Personal Webpage

In Exercise 1, we created a simple personal webpage using HTML.
The purpose of this exercise was to become familiar with basic HTML elements, including headings, lists, links, images, and forms.
All the required images and text were provided in the supplementary folder, and the final product demonstrated a basic but complete personal site layout.

Exercise 2 – University of Calgary History Page

In Exercise 2, we created a structured HTML webpage modeled after the University of Calgary’s History page

This exercise focused on building a well-organized layout using tables, headings, paragraphs, images, and hyperlinks.
We explored how table-based structures can be used to separate content into sections, adjust element alignment, and balance visual flow.
The project also introduced responsive design concepts, testing how fixed and percentage-based table widths affect page adaptability.
