Lab 08 – Web Scraping and Data Analysis with Python

In this lab, we created a Python-based web analysis tool using BeautifulSoup to extract, analyze, and visualize information from webpages

Exercise 1 – Setting Up BeautifulSoup

We installed and configured the BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries, then used them to fetch and parse the HTML content of a webpage (Wikipedia’s University of Calgary page). The parsed content allowed us to easily extract and analyze elements like headings, links, and paragraphs.

Exercise 2 – Content Analysis

Using the BeautifulSoup API, we wrote Python scripts to count the number of <h1>–<h6>, <a>, and <p> tags. We also implemented keyword and word frequency analysis by converting the HTML text into plain text and applying string and list operations to identify the most frequently occurring words.

Exercise 3 – Visualization

Finally, we visualized the extracted data using Matplotlib, creating a bar chart showing the counts of headings, links, and paragraphs. This reinforced the connection between data extraction, analysis, and visualization in full-stack development workflows.
