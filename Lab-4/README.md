Lab 04 – JavaScript Fundamentals
Exercise 1 – Exploring JavaScript Fundamentals

In Exercise 1, we practiced foundational JavaScript concepts, including working with variables, strings, template literals, and dates. We created a simple HTML file containing a <script> block and executed our code in the browser’s Developer Console.

Through a series of small tasks, we learned how to declare variables with let and const, manipulate and combine strings, and apply string methods such as concatenation and replacement. We also worked with the Date object to extract and display components such as the year, month, and day, and converted numeric days into weekday names using an array. This exercise built a strong foundation in syntax and data handling for client-side scripting.

Exercise 2 – Building a Simple Calculator

In Exercise 2, we deepened our understanding of JavaScript functions by creating a simple calculator application. We defined traditional and arrow functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and learned to use default parameters to handle missing arguments gracefully.

We then implemented a callback-based calculator function that accepted two numbers and a function reference, allowing flexible operations through functional programming principles. Each function was tested directly in the Developer Console, reinforcing debugging skills and illustrating the power of modular, reusable code in JavaScript.

Exercise 3 – Managing Data with JavaScript

In Exercise 3, we focused on managing structured data using arrays, objects, and destructuring. We began by creating and modifying an array named classRoster, applying array methods such as push, shift, and toString to manipulate and display data.

Next, we created a nested object called classInfo to represent a course, incorporating strings, arrays, and an embedded details object. We updated object properties dynamically, logged specific values, and used destructuring to extract elements and nested data into individual variables. This exercise demonstrated practical ways to organize, access, and modify data efficiently in modern JavaScript.
